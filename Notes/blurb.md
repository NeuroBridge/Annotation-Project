# Project Name

**Notes:** this could be part of something larger, like meta-analysis or review paper projects.

Work activities:

Students working on this project will read and review papers covering topics in neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience. While reading the papers they will search for and annotate critical text features (specific words and sentences) that identify aspects of the experimental design and analysis:

1. How the data was collected
2. Participant populations
3. Types of cognitive tests used
4. etc.

Students will be expected to read/review a specific number of papers each week, and enter the annotations into an online system. Students with particularly high-quality performance in these tasks may be asked to review/curate the annotations applied by others.

Specific student skills:

1. Gives students exposure to the neuroimaging literature
2. Provides opportunities for students to learn about:
   - Scientific ontologies and semantic web systems
   - Tools used for semantic markup (Inception)
   - How to work with controlled vocabularies and systematically organized knowledge
3. Students have the opportunity to present on the material to a larger multi-site collaboration
