# Notes: Annotation Methods paper

How can we spin an EDU paper out of this?

Workflow:

- Beforehand:
  - Procedures for initial paper identification
- Process (phase 0):
  - Annotation teams worked on papers in "physical space"
  - a tight feedback loop was formed with the ontology developers
  - Iteration between annotations and new terms being introduced
  - End result:
    - Controlled vocab/ontology
    - Preliminary spreadsheets with detailed annotations and notes
    - Both of the above as inputs to phase 2
  - Note that this phase drops papers that were automatically collected and irrelevant
- Process (phase 1):
  - (new) annotators using inception as tool for markup (shared online space)
  - Phases and waves
  - Curators versus annotators
  - Annotator teams and coordination across sites
  - CI/CD workflow
- Future phases
  - Goal of each phase is to do labels for which there is general consensus
  - During each phase, new ideas/annotation targets are identified and set aside for the next phase


Additional points:

These fit in somehow?

- Inception's role in all of this versus spreadsheet methods, etc.
- CI/CD methods (not really agile but a lot of what the agile paper suggests)
- Annotation as training for curators
- Phase 0 as training for phase 1/later workers
  - Importance of phase 0 loop between annotation and vocab development
