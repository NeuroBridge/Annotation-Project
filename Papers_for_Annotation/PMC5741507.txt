Altered anterior cingulate cortex to hippocampus effective connectivity in response to drug cues in men with cocaine use disorder
Drug-related attentional bias may have significant implications for the treatment of cocaine use disorder (CocUD). However, the neurobiology of attentional bias is not completely understood. This study employed dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to conduct an analysis of effective (directional) connectivity involved in drug-related attentional bias in treatment-seeking CocUD subjects. The DCM analysis was conducted based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired from fifteen CocUD subjects while performing a cocaine-word Stroop task, during which blocks of Cocaine Words (CW) and Neutral Words (NW) alternated. There was no significant attentional bias at group level. Although no significant brain activation was found, the DCM analysis found that, relative to the NW, the CW caused a significant increase in the strength of the right (R) anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to R hippocampus effective connectivity. Greater increase of this connectivity was associated with greater CW reaction time (relative to NW reaction time). The increased strength of R ACC to R hippocampus connectivity may reflect ACC activation of hippocampal memories related to drug use, which was triggered by the drug cues. This circuit could be a potential target for therapeutics in CocUD patients. No significant change was found in the other modeled connectivities.
1. INTRODUCTION
Individuals with cocaine use disorder (CocUD) often show drug related attentional bias. This phenomenon refers to exaggerated attention to drug cues, which results in longer reaction times to drug related stimuli than to neutral stimuli. A related concept is drug cue reactivity, a kind of learned response which is often observed in individuals with substance use disorders and involves significant reactions (physiological and subjective) to drug cues (i.e., drug-related stimuli). The attentional bias and cue reactivity are commonly tested by comparing the measures obtained during exposure to drug stimuli versus neutral/non-drug-related stimuli in the same sensory domain. While visual stimuli (words and pictures) were mainly used in attentional bias studies (see, for review), stimuli used in cue reactivity studies are relatively versatile (see Jasinska et al., 2014, for review), including visual (words, pictures, and videos), auditory, audiovisual, tactile or haptic, olfactory or gustatory, or combined sensory domains. Surveys of the neuroimaging studies on attentional bias and drug cue reactivity (Jasinska et al., 2014) revealed that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum are common brain regions critical for both drug related attentional bias and drug cue reactivity. However, we are not aware any study which directly compares the neural networks underlying attentinoal bias and cue reactivity. A cocaine Stroop task, in which drug-related words are presented intermixed with neutral words, was used in the present study. Because drug Stroop tasks are commonly used to test drug related attnetional bias, we focused on attentional bias (rather than drug cue reactivity) in the remaining parts of this paper.
Based on the regional activation studies (e.g.,) which have employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate attentional bias in CocUD and other substance use disorders, hypothesized that the neural correlates underlying attentional bias result from the abnormal control of prefrontal regions over the emotion/reward regions, such as amygdala, hippocampus, insula, and striatum. A survey of these imaging studies and behavioral studies investigating attentional bias in CocUD indicates that drug cue reactivity was consistently reported in the behavioral studies, but the findings from the imaging studies are somewhat heterogeneous. Thus, more research is necessary to understand neuronal correlates underlying attentional bias in CocUD.
Cognitive processes depend on interactions among brain regions. Functional connectivity and effective connectivity analyses are two commonly used brain connectivity methods. Functional connectivity refers to correlations among spatially remote neurophysiological events, while effective connectivity measures the causal (hence directional) influence of the neuronal activity in one region on a second region. To date, one functional connectivity study and one effective connectivity study which investigated attentional bias in CocUD subjects have been published. found that attentional bias could be related to a functional connectivity network consisting of frontal, occipitotemporal, parietal, cingulate, and premotor cortex. reported that during exposure to cocaine-related cues, CocUD subjects showed a particular feed-forward effective connectivity pattern (the feed-forward connectivities are the connectivities that do not form a cycle using feedback) among the nodes of a network (amygdala to hippocampus to dorsal striatum to insula to medial frontal cortex, DLPFC, and ACC). This effective connectivity pattern was not observed in control subjects exposed to cocaine-associated cues.
As hypothesized by, the abnormal control of prefrontal regions over the emotion/reward regions, could be the neural basis underlying drug related attentional bias. A previous effective connectivity study reported significant effects of the emotion/reward regions over the prefrontal regions. However, there is no direct evidence supporting the critical role of the prefrontal regions over the emotion/reward regions during attentional bias. Thus, there is still a gap between theory and human imaging research regarding neuronal circuits underlying attentional bias. The present study aimed to reduce this gap through testing the effects exerted by the prefrontal regions over the emotion/reward regions. Toward that end, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was used to measure the effective connectivity upon exposure to cocaine-related cues in CocUD subjects. Effective connectivity rather than functional connectivity was selected because the direction of connectivity is modeled in effective connectivity, but the direction of connectivity cannot be determined using functional connectivity. Thus, effective connectivity analysis can distinguish the effects exerted by the prefrontal regions over the emotion/reward regions versus the effects exerted by the emotion/reward regions over the prefrontal regions. DCM has two major advantages over other effective connectivity analytic techniques. First, disease or drugs could affect neurovascular coupling and/or hemodynamic responses. In DCM, the parameter for the ratio of intra- and extravascular signals in the hemodynamic model of DCM is estimated from the observed blood oxygen level dependent signal, thus accounting for the individual difference in neurovascular coupling and/or hemodynamic responses. Second, DCM can measure effective connectivity under specific experimental conditions, rather than for the experiment as a whole. For example, the present study used a cocaine-word Stroop task in which blocks of cocaine words (CW) and neutral words (NW) alternated. DCM can distinguish the effective connectivity occurring upon exposure to CW versus NW, thus allowing measurement of the differential effects exerted by exposure to CW relative to NW on effective connectivity.
Heightened drug cue salience is associated with enhanced attention and with boosted unconscious memory processing of drug cues in CocUD subjects. The ACC plays an important role in attention and contributes to the recall of past memories. The hippocampus is necessary in processing contextual cues by which memories may be retrieved. Based on these previous studies and evidence showing the involvement of ACC and hippocampus in drug related attentional bias, we hypothesized that relative to NW, CW would significantly increase ACC to hippocampus effective connectivity, reflecting recall of past memory about drug use. In addition, we hypothesized that greater increases in connectivity would be associated with greater CW reaction time (relative to NW reaction time).
2. METHODS
2.1 Subjects
The study was officially approved by the local Institutional Review Board, and was performed in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). Informed consent was obtained from each subject. The CocUD subjects were from a treatment study, in which the majority of the participants were male. All MRI scans took place prior to the initiation of medication treatment. All subjects were screened using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and underwent physical examination and medical history. The Addiction Severity Index was obtained to document lifetime drug and alcohol use. Female subjects were screened with a urine pregnancy test immediately prior to MRI scanning. Each subject’s urine was screened for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, and benzodiazepines (Syva Company, Deerfield, IL), and each subject was screened for alcohol with an Intoximeter Alco-Sensor III breathalyzer (Intoximeters, Inc., St. Louis, MO) immediately prior to MRI scanning.
Subject inclusion criteria were: (1) 18–55 years old; (2) right-handed; (3) free of alcohol at the time of MRI scanning; (4) met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for current cocaine dependence based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Exclusion criteria were: (1) subjects who met current or past DSM-IV Axis I disorder other than substance abuse or substance dependence; (2) medical disorders or taking medication that may affect the central nervous system; (3) claustrophobia experienced during MRI or MRI simulator sessions; (4) any definite or suspected clinically significant abnormalities of the brain on Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MRI scans; (5) positive pregnancy test result. Based on above criteria, fifteen CocUD subjects, among the 26 CocUD subjects who were scanned, were included for final analysis. See Table 1 for the demographics and drug-use information of these subjects. This is a free-standing study; all the CocUD subjects (n=26) who were scanned were considered. Eleven CocUD subjects were excuded because of either missing behavioral performance data (n=1); excessive head motion during the fMRI scan (n=2); clinically significant abnormal results on FLAIR scan of the brain (n=4); subject’s request to terminate the scanning (n=2); or current alcohol dependence (n=2). The majority of the participants were male. The one female subject who was scanned was excluded because of excessive head motion.
2.2 Cocaine-word Stroop fMRI Task
The subject was presented with ten cocaine words (CW) and ten neutral words (NW), one word at a time. The CW and NW were matched in letter length. Both CW (e.g., “cocaine”, “crack”) and NW (e.g., “kitchen”, “table”) were frequently used words in the English language. Each word when presented was randomly printed in one of three different colors (blue, green, or red). The subject was instructed to ignore the meaning of the word and to press the appropriate button to denote the color in which the word was printed. Each word was shown for a maximum duration of 1800 ms (if no response), but the display of the word was terminated by a response, after which a blank screen was shown for the remainder of the trial up to 1900 ms. The next trial immediately began with the presentation of the next word. Four CW blocks and four NW blocks alternated with a 12 s pause between blocks. Within each block (58 s per block), thirty words were presented. The effect of drug cues on the reaction times (ΔRT) was measured by the mean reaction time during all the CW blocks minus that during all of the NW blocks, i.e., ΔRT = RT(CW) minus RT(NW). Only the correct-response trials were included when calculating the mean reaction times. ΔRT was treated as a measure of attentional bias at the behavioral level in the present study.
2.3 fMRI Data Acquisition
MRI data were acquired on a Philips 3.0 T Intera system with an eight channel receive head coil (Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands). Single shot spin echo echoplanar imaging (EPI) was used for acquiring fMRI data. The fMRI acquisition parameters were: SENSE acceleration factor 2.0, repetition time 2500 ms, echo time 75 ms, flip angle 90 degrees, field of view 240 mm × 240 mm, in-plane resolution 3.75 mm × 3.75 mm, 25 axial slices, slice thickness 3.75 mm, interslice gap 1.25 mm, 224 repetitions per run after 10 dummy acquisitions, total duration per run was 10 min 40 s.
2.4 fMRI Preprocessing
During an fMRI run, individual scans in which the fMRI signal exceeded plus or minus four standard deviations from the mean were considered to be outliers and were replaced by the mean of the two nearest neighbors using the Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) software command “3dDespike” (http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/). All subsequent preprocessing used Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) software (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) implemented in Matlab R2007b (Mathworks Inc. Sherborn MA, USA). After slice timing correction, the fMRI series was realigned to the first image to correct for head motion. Runs with head motion greater than 1 voxel (3.75 mm translation on any axis) or rotation greater than 3.75 degrees were removed from the analysis. The anatomical image was coregistered to the fMRI images and spatially transformed to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard atlas coordinates using the SPM12 Normalise module with the SPM12 T1 MNI template image. The transformation parameters were applied to the fMRI images, which were resliced to 2 mm isotropic resolution and spatially smoothed with a Gaussian filter of 8 mm isotropic full width at half maximum.
2.5 SPM univariate analysis
First level univariate statistical analysis of the fMRI data was conducted using SPM12. CW and NW blocks (conditions) were modeled by boxcar functions convolved with the SPM12 canonical hemodynamic response function. The parameters for each condition were estimated using the General Linear Model at each voxel without global normalization. The fMRI time series was high-pass filtered with an optimized cut-off period of 188 s determined by the Fourier transformation of each condition’s time model. Attentional bias activation was defined as the contrast at each voxel of the parameter estimate for CW blocks minus the parameter estimate for NW blocks (CW minus NW contrast). The resulting set of voxel values for this contrast constitutes a statistical parametric map for that contrast. The CW minus NW contrast image (one per subject) was then entered at the SPM12 second level (i.e., random effects) group analysis.
To determine the group level blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activation, a SPM12 second level Random Effects one-sample t-test was conducted voxel-wise throughout the whole brain for the contrast image (CW minus NW). Statistical significance was defined as family-wise error (FWE) corrected cluster probability (p) less than 0.05 (two tail). The brain activations found by this analysis were used for DCM nodes (regions of interest) selection, but the statistical significance was defined as uncorrected cluster p less than 0.05 (two tail). It is commonly accepted to use uncorrected cluster p less than 0.05 (two tail) for determining DCM nodes. For all SPM12 second level analyses, the cluster-defining threshold was t = 2.4. Anatomical labels for regions of activation were determined using the Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) toolbox.
2.6 Dynamic causal modeling
FMRI-based DCM is a biophysical model of the underlying neuronal connectivity and of how the neuronal connectivity generates the observed BOLD signal. DCM with stochastic option, as implemented in SPM12 (Revision 6906), was used for effective connectivity analysis. DCM has been described elsewhere. In brief, the mathematical model of the underlying neuronal connectivity among an a priori selected set of brain regions is a system of bilinear differential state equations with coefficients specified by three matrices (A matrix, B matrix and C matrix). In this model, the experimental conditions (i.e., CW and NW) can serve as inputs to the model as either driving inputs, or modulatory inputs, or both. The DCM analysis determines which particular nodes in the model exhibit effective connectivity with other specific nodes in the model, which nodes receive driving inputs from experimental conditions into the model, and which specific connectivities between nodes in the model are modulated (i.e., changed in connectivity strength, in units of Hz) under experimental conditions. A node (driving input location) in the model that receives driving inputs, as quantified by the C matrix parameters, is the brain region among the nodes in the model which first experiences a change in neuronal activity. The node that receives the driving input then influences (“drives”) the connectivity to other nodes in the model. The endogenous (or fixed) connectivity in DCM is quantified by the A matrix parameters, which measure the effective connectivity strengths (in units of Hz) between nodes, regardless of the moment-to-moment switching on and off of inputs. Experimental conditions (CW and NW) can modulate the endogenous connectivity among nodes. These modulation effects are quantified by the B matrix parameters as increased or decreased connectivity strength compared to the endogenous connectivity at different times in the experiment that are related to the timing of changes in the particular experimental conditions.
2.6.1 DCM nodes
DCM node selection criteria were: (1) the brain activations found in this study,(2) previous fMRI studies using cocaine stimulus Stroop tasks (e.g.,), and (3) theories about attentional bias (e.g.,). Based on meeting the combined presence of all of the above three criteria, the following five regions served as nodes for the DCM analysis: (1) left (L) anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (x= −8, y=46, z= −4); (2) R ACC (x=10, y=26, z=24); (3) right (R) insula (x=42, y= −10, z= −6); (4) R hippocampus (x=36, y= −18, z= −14); and (5) L caudate (x= −18, y= −8, z=22). The x, y, z values are the MNI coordinates of the center of each node, which were defined as a sphere with 5 mm radius and centered at local maximum of the regional fMRI activation corresponding to that node. For each node, the functional activation BOLD time-series, which was used for DCM analysis, was extracted using the methods described in.
2.6.2 Driving input and modulatory input
The CW and NW experimental conditions were not directly used as inputs. Following and, we created a parametric regressor for “All Words” contrast, and another parametric regressor for CW minus NW contrast. The method of constructing these regressors can be found online (https://github.com/HaukeHillebrandt/SPM_connectome). The “All Words” contrast, which reflects the common features of the CW and NW, was used as a single input to the DCM (driving input). The CW minus NW contrast, which reflects the special effect of CW over NW, was used as a putative modulator (modulatory input) of effective connectivity (the factor causing changes in the effective connectivities). In the present study, the changes of effective connectivities (relative to the endogenous connectivities) caused by the CW minus NW modulator are termed as modulatory changes. By definition, a modulatory change reflects the change in an effective connectivity caused by the CW minus the change in this effective connectivity caused by the NW. Thus the effects of drug cues (CW) on the behavioral performance (reaction time), brain activation, and effective connectivity were all assessed relative to NW in the present study.
2.6.3 DCM inference
Given the nodes of the model, a DCM post-hoc optimization analysis was used for model structure inference. Starting from a fully-connected model, the post hoc optimization analysis systematically searches for an optimal “sparse” model that determines which particular nodes exhibit effective connectivity with other nodes (i.e., endogenous connectivity), which nodes first experience a change in neuronal activity associated with the “All Words” input (i.e., driving input effects), and which effective connectivities showed modulatory changes associated with the CW minus NW modulator. Based on the results of the post hoc optimization analysis, a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) analysis was conducted for DCM parameter inference, with a model space consisting of the fully-connected model and the optimal sparse model. BMA averages each DCM parameter across models (and across subjects) such that the contribution of each model (of each subject) for that parameter was weighted by the model’s posterior probability.
3. RESULTS
3.1 Behavioral results
During the performance of the cocaine-word Stroop task, the ΔRT was 1.2 ± 30.7 ms (mean ± standard deviation [STD]) for the 15 CocUD subjects. The mean of ΔRT was not significantly different from zero (t=0.15, DoF=14, p=0.88). The accuracy was 92% ± 4% and 91% ± 6% for the CW and NW periods, respectively. The difference in the accuracy was not significant between the CW period and the NW period (t=0.5371, DoF=28, p=0.5955). Eight subjects had ΔRT greater than zero. Among these subjects, two had positive cocaine UDS and positive THC UDS, four had positive cocaine UDS, and two had negative UDS. Seven subjects had ΔRT less than zero. Among these subjects, one had positive cocaine UDS and positive THC UDS, three had positive cocaine UDS, one had positive THC UDS, and one had negative UDS. Among the seven subjects with positive cocaine UDS, four subjects had ΔRT greater than zero, and the other three subjects had ΔRT less than zero.
3.2 Brain activation results
No significant regional brain activation (FWE corrected two-tailed cluster p greater than 0.10) was found for the CW minus NW contrast. However, several clusters were found with the uncorrected two-tailed cluster level p less than 0.05 (uncorrected, two-tail), in portions of ACC, hippocampus, insula, caudate and other brain regions. See Figure 1 and Table 2 for the detailed information about these clusters. The results of the regional activation analysis were used along with the other selection criteria (see Methods section) to select the nodes for DCM analysis.
3.3 DCM connectivity results
The group level mean and STD of each DCM parameter were obtained from the outputs of the BMA analysis. The mean and STD of each modulatory change are shown in Table 3. The mean and STD of each driving input effect and endogenous connectivity are shown in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively. The BMA analysis revealed that the modulatory change of the R ACC to R hippocampus effective connectivity (caused by the CW minus NW modulator) was 0.0444 ± 0.0121 Hz. A Student t-test showed that the modulatory change on the R ACC to R hippocampus effective connectivity was significantly different from zero (Bonferroni corrected p < 0.0020). The modulatory changes on the remaining 19 effective connectivities in the network were not significantly different from zero (Bonferroni corrected p> 0.7569). A BMA analysis was conducted separately in the subjects showing attentional bias (AB+) and the subjects not showing attentional bias (AB−) respectively. The mean and STD of each modulatory change are shown in Table 3. The modulatory change of the R ACC to R hippocampus effective connectivity (caused by the CW minus NW modulator) was 0.0684 ± 0.0272 Hz for the AB+ subjects, and 0.0149 ± 0.0282 Hz for the AB− subjects. This modulatory change was significantly greater than zero for the AB+ subjects (Bonferroni corrected p = 0.0038), but not significantly different from zero for the AB− subjects (uncorrected p= 0.2116). In addition, this modulatory change was marginally different between the AB+ subjects and the AB− subjects (Bonferroni corrected p = 0.0507). The modulatory changes on the remaining 19 effective connectivities in the network were not significantly different from zero for the AB+ subjects (Bonferroni corrected p> 0.7716) and AB− subjects (Bonferroni corrected p> 0.7182), and did not show significant (or marginally significant) difference between the AB+ subjects and AB− subjects (Bonferroni corrected p=1).
3.4 Correlation results
A Spearman partial correlation analysis was used to test the a priori hypothesis that the modulatory change in the R ACC to R hippocampus effective connectivity would correlate with the ΔRT in CocUD subjects. The parameters measuring drug use, i.e., lifetime cocaine use (years), past 30 days usage (days), total KMSK score [Kreek-McHugh-Schluger-Kellogg score ], and UDS results, were included in the analysis as covariates. The correlation between ΔRT and the modulatory change on the R ACC to R hippocampus was statistically significant (rho=0.7525, p=0.0120), with greater increase in strength of R ACC to R hippocampus effective connectivity associated with greater ΔRT. The scatter plot illustrating the modulatory change in this effective connectivity vs. the ΔRT is shown in Figure 2. A full Spearman correlation analysis (i.e., no covariates) yielded a similar result: the modulatory change on the R ACC to R hippocampus was significantly and positively correlated to ΔRT (rho=0.6393, p=0.0123).
4. DISCUSSION
Drug related attentional bias was evaluated in fifteen CocUD subjects using behavioral data, regional brain activation, and effective connectivity. Although no significant results were found in the behavioral data analysis and the brain regional activation analysis, the DCM analysis found that relative to the neutral word condition, the cocaine word condition caused a significant increase in the strength of the R ACC to R hippocampus effective connectivity. In addition, the increase of this connectivity was positively associated with the cocaine word condition reaction time (relative to neutral word condition reaction time). These results support the hypothesis that the abnormal control of prefrontal regions over the emotion/reward regions, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, insula, and/or striatum, could be the neural basis underlying attentional bias. Different from a previous effective connectivity study which reported significant effects of the emotion/reward regions over the prefrontal regions, the present study revealed that the inverse circuit, i.e., the ACC to hippocampus effective connectivity, may also be important for drug related attentional bias as well. The identification of this circuit (R ACC to R hippocampus effective connectivity) reduces the gap between the existing theories regarding drug related attentional bias and current human imaging research. Activation of brain circuits associated with attentional bias could serve as a predictor or a target of treatment outcome in CocUD. Thus, the circuit found in this study could serve as a potentially novel target for treatment and preclinical studies.
The DCM analysis revealed that the CW minus NW modulator was related to a significant increase in the R ACC to R hippocampus effective connectivity during the cocaine-word Stroop task. In addition, the modulatory change in this effective connectivity associated positively with ΔRT in the CocUD subjects. These findings are similar to the results of a previous fMRI study in which the investigators found that in smokers there was a positive correlation between attentional bias to smoking words and brain activation (based on the contrast of smoking stimuli minus neutral stimuli) in the hippocampus and other brain regions (amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, insula, and occipital cortex). suggested that smoking cues may trigger smoking-affiliated memories, leading to the mental rehearsal of past smoking experiences. This suggestion was based on the role of hippocampus in memory recollection, which was defined as “the recovery of qualitative associations prompted by a critical cue”. While DCM based effective connectivity does not require direct structural (or anatomical) connectivity, a recent study has found a direct structural connection (cingulum bundle) between ACC and hippocampus in humans. The ACC is a cortical region found to be important in recall of past memory (see for review). As concluded by, the ACC supports attention to and recognition of the cues that are most relevant to successful recall of behaviors learned in the past. Thus, based on the results reported by and the function of ACC in past memory recall, our DCM finding provides further support for the importance of the ACC and hippocampus in drug cue related memories. The positive correlation between the modulatory change of the R ACC to R hippocampus effective connectivity and ΔRT supports this interpretation and implies that memories associated with drug use may be relatively more easily triggered by drug cues in the CocUD subjects with greater attentional bias.
Our results of increased connectivity between the R ACC to R hippocampus differ from a previous effective connectivity study. These between-study differences could be related to the nodes analyzed as well as differences in visual stimuli (words vs. pictures), study design (within group vs. between-group), and/or effective connectivity analysis methods. The present study focused on the modulatory changes in effective connectivities exerted by the CW minus NW modulator, which reflects the differential effect of CW over NW. assessed effective connectivities during the cocaine-stimuli period only. Thus the effects of the neutral-stimuli were not accounted for in that study.
In the current study, for the CocUD group as a whole, the average difference between the reaction time during CW and the reaction time during NW was not statistically different. The results of previous fMRI studies are mixed with regard to whether CocUD subjects show greater reaction time when exposed to drug stimuli than when exposed to neutral stimuli. Two studies did not find a significant difference in reaction time between cocaine stimuli and neutral stimuli, unlike the results from five other studies (e.g.,). In addition, reaction time results were not reported in several other studies. These data suggest that the CocUD subjects may not always show attentional bias when exposed to drug cues. This is particularly true for the in-scanner version of the cocaine-stimuli Stroop task, as opposed to the consistent findings of attentional bias for the cocaine-stimuli Stroop tasks used in behavioral laboratory studies in the absence of concurrent fMRI analyses.
Regional activation analyses were also conducted in the present study. No significant clusters (FWE corrected two tailed cluster p > 0.10) were found at the group level (for the CW – NW contrast), This lack of statistical significance and the hypoactivation (uncorrected two-tailed cluster p < 0.05) in R ACC, R insula, and R lingual gyrus are consistent with the findings in one previous study. The similarity between the present study and is the use of the cocaine word Stroop task and within-group design. Significant clusters were reported in another within-group design study which used a working memory task with neutral and cocaine pictures as distractors. This across-study difference supports the opinion of that the task employed to test attentional bias is a factor which contributes to the variation in results across studies.
A strength of the present study is the use of the CW minus NW modulator in DCM. By definition, the modulatory change on the R ACC to R hippocampus effective connectivity reflects the influence of drug cue on the neurocircuitry (the effect of CW relative to NW). In contrast, the functional connectivity in was measured using the time series as a whole (including both CW and NW), while in a second study, the effective connectivity was assessed solely during the cocaine-stimuli period.
One of the limitations of the present study is the lack of drug cue related attentional bias at the averaged group level. The lack of attentional bias may be related to our inclusion/exclusion criteria (i.e., CocUD participants were included regardless of their UDS results). However, among the seven subjects with positive cocaine UDS, four showed attentional bias, and the other three subjects did not show attentional bias, suggesting that in the present study, the attentional bias could not be further evidenced by including only those who had positive UDS. Thus, the inclusion/exclusion criteria are unlikely to account for the null finding in group averaged behavioral performance. Nevertheless, the present study and previous studies indicated that in some cases, there was no average attentional bias for the CocUD group during the in-scanner versions of the Stroop tasks. Even in studies (e.g.,) reporting average group level attentional bias, not all the CocUD subjects showed attentional bias during the drug cue related Stroop tasks (See Figure 1 in as an example). These findings in the previous studies reflect individual difference in attentional bias among the CocUD individuals. Indeed, individual difference in attentional bias (or approach tendency bias) has been reported in CocUD and other substance use disorders. Focusing on individual differences associated with altered cognitive function has been suggested to be a strategy to improve the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. As suggested by and consistent with our findings, the presence of attentional bias could be an individual variable to consider for the evaluation of cognitive treatment in CocUD. The preliminary post-hoc analysis revealed that during the cocaine Stroop task, the CocUD subjects showing attentional bias and those not showing attentional bias had marginally different effective connectivity. Another limitation of the present study is the variance in the UDS results, which reflect recent drug use. As discussed above, the variance in the UDS results is unlikely to account for the lack of attentional bias in the present study. In addition, the correlation between the effective connectivity and ΔRT was significant whether the UDS results were included as covariates or not included, suggesting that the variance in the UDS results did not affect the relationship between the effective connectivity and ΔRT. However, we cannot exclude a negative effect of the variance in the UDS results on the replicabililty of the fMRI results. The third limitation is the limited number of analyzed ROIs (nodes). It is possible that other neural interconnectivities are also important for attentional bias but were not identified because the connecting regions were not included as nodes for the DCM analysis. One reason for the exclusion of potential nodes is study feasibility. With the increase in the number of nodes, the time needed for the DCM analysis increases quadratically. Thus, node selection criteria were used to control the number of nodes. Another reason was diminished statistical power for fMRI activation due to the variance in UDS results and the small sample size, which is another limitation of the present study. Future studies with more subjects and more strict inclusion/exclusion criteria will be helpful in providing greater insight into the altered neuronal effective connectivity underlying attentional bias in the CocUD subjects.

Highlights
This study investigated attentional bias in cocaine use disorder.
Dynamic causal modeling was used to assess underlying neural circuits.
Drug cues caused increase in anterior cingulate cortex to hippocampus effective connectivity.
Greater increase of this connectivity was associated with greater reaction time during drug cues.
May reflect anterior cingulate cortex activation of hippocampal memories related to drug use.
