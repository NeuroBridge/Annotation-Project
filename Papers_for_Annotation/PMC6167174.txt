Expression of dopamine D2 and D3 receptors in the human retina revealed by positron emission tomography and targeted mass spectrometry
Dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) are expressed in the human retina and play an important role in the modulation of neural responses to light-adaptation. However, it is unknown whether dopamine D3 receptors (D3R) are expressed in the human retina. Using positron emission tomography (PET), we have observed significant uptake of the D3R-preferring agonist radiotracer [11C]-(+)-PHNO into the retina of humans in vivo. This led us to examine whether [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the retina was quantifiable using reference tissue methods and if D3R are expressed in human post-mortem retinal tissue. [11C]-(+)-PHNO data from 49 healthy controls (mean age: 39.96 ± 14.36; 16 female) and 12 antipsychotic-naïve patients with schizophrenia (mean age: 25.75 ± 6.25; 4 female) were analyzed. We observed no differences in [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the retina between first-episode, drug-naïve patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Post-mortem retinal tissues from four healthy persons (mean age: 59.75 ± 9.11; 2 female) and four patients with schizophrenia (mean age: 54 ± 17.11; 2 female) were analyzed using a targeted mass spectrometry technique: parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis. Using targeted mass spectrometry, we confirmed that D3R are expressed in human retinal tissue ex vivo. Notably, there was far greater expression of D2R relative to D3R in the healthy human retina (~12:1). Moreover, PRM analysis revealed reduced D2R, but not D3R, expression in the retinas of non-first episode patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. We confirm that D3R are expressed in the human retina. Future studies are needed to determine what proportion of the [11C]-(+)-PHNO signal in the human retina in vivo is due to binding to D3R versus D2R. Knowledge that both D2R and D3R are expressed in the human retina, and potentially quantifiable in vivo using [11C]-(+)-PHNO, poses new research avenues for better understanding the role of retinal dopamine in human vision. This work may have important implications for elucidating pathophysiological and antipsychotic induced visual deficits in schizophrenia.
1. Introduction
Dopamine (DA) is a major neurotransmitter in the modulation of neural adaptations to light in the retina of mammals. In this regard, DA D2 receptors (D2R) are thought to mediate several important functional roles. For example, the retinal circadian clock controls the extent and strength of rod-cone coupling (ensuring dim-light signals from rods are received by cones at night, but not in the day) through activation of D2R during the daytime. Moreover, D2R are expressed on Müller glial cells and may affect photoreceptor survival by regulating the release of neuroprotective factors, especially during stress.
It has been established that DA D2 receptors (D2R) are expressed in the retinas of all vertebrate species examined to date, including humans. Whether this is also true for the DA D3 receptor (D3R) is unclear. Direct quantification of D3R has been difficult due to a lack of compounds and antibodies selective for D3R as opposed to D2R. While evidence of D3R mRNA has been observed in the retina of zebrafish, this has not been observed in the retina of rodents; with several rodent studies employing non-specific antibodies or radioligands for D2R and D3R. Moreover, whether D3R are expressed in the retina of humans remains unclear. An un-published abstract suggests that D3R mRNA could not be detected in human post-mortem retinal tissue. Moreover, autoradiographic studies have employed nonspecific radioligands for D2R and D3R.
The positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer [11C]-(+)-PHNO is an agonist for DA D2R and D3R. Notably, [11C]-(+)-PHNO has been shown to have greater in vivo selectivity for D3R relative to D2R than other D2/3R PET tracers such as [18F]fallypride and [11C]raclopride. This in vivo preference of [11C]-(+)-PHNO to bind to D3R relative to D2R is unique, and occurs despite the fact that other radiotracers like [18F]-fallypride demonstrate greater in vitro affinity for D3R than [11C]-(+)-PHNO. Using a high-resolution head-dedicated PET camera, we observed what appeared to be significant uptake of [11C]-(+)-PHNO in the retinas of human participants (see Fig. 1). Notably, we did not observe similar uptake into the retina with the antagonist radiotracer [11C]-raclopride, which does not have significant binding to D3R in vivo.
In this investigation, we set out to determine whether the [11C]-(+)-PHNO signal in the retina could be meaningfully quantified using typical pharmacokinetic modelling approaches. Given growing evidence of multiple retinal abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia, we further explored whether [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the retina was different between first-episode, drug-naïve patients with schizophrenia, and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Using targeted mass spectrometry, we then set out to determine whether D3R are expressed in post-mortem human retinal tissue. This included retinal samples from healthy persons and age- and sex-matched persons with schizophrenia, to complement our in vivo data with [11C]-(+)-PHNO.
2. Material and methods
2.1. [11C]-(+)-PHNO participants
PET data from healthy persons and drug-naive persons with schizophrenia, previously reported in the literature, were re-analyzed for the current investigation. These studies were approved by the Research Ethics Board of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto. Healthy participants were right-handed adults free of any major medical or psychiatric disorders as determined by clinical interview, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Plus (MINI-Plus), basic clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiography. Participants with schizophrenia were antipsychotic-naïve and met criteria for the diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder based on the DSM-IV and the MINI-Plus. Participants were excluded if they had a current diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence, a history of clinically significant physical illness, or metal implants precluding the ability to be scanned with MRI. At inclusion and before the PET scan, participants were required to have a negative urine screen for drugs of abuse and/or pregnancy. All participants provided written informed consent. The average age of illness onset for the patient sample was 24.42 ± 6.75 (range: 17–42), with an average duration of illness of 16.33 ± 14.74 (range: 2–48) months.
2.2. [11C]-(+)-PHNO synthesis & acquisition
A full description of the radiosynthesis of [11C]-(+)-PHNO, as well as how PET images were acquired, can be found in previous publications. Briefly, [11C]-propionyl chloride was reacted with 9-hydroxynaph-thoxazine to generate a [11C]-amide. This was subsequently reduced by lithium aluminium hydride. Purification by HPLC and formulation gave radio-chemically pure [11C]-(+)-PHNO as a sterile, pyrogen-free solution. PET images were acquired using a high-resolution head-dedicated PET camera system (CPS-HRRT; Siemens Molecular Imaging, USA). The CPS-HRRT measures radioactivity in 207 brain slices, each with a thickness of 1.2 mm. The in-plane resolution was approximately 2.8 mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). Notably, significant [11C]-(+)-PHNO uptake into the retina could not be observed on scans collected using a high-resolution PET CT, Siemens-Biograph HiRez XVI (Siemens Molecular Imaging, Knoxville, TN, USA) operating in 3D mode with an in-plane resolution of approximately 4.6 mm FWHM (almost half the resolution of the CPS-HRRT). Thus, PET camera systems of ~2.8 mm FWHM or better are likely required to have the appropriate resolution to image [11C]-(+)-PHNO uptake into the retina. Transmission scans were acquired using a 137Cs (T1/2=30.2 yr, E=662 KeV) single photon point source to provide attenuation correction, and the emission data were acquired in list mode. The raw data were reconstructed by filtered-back projection and the emission data were re-binned into a series of 3D sonograms. Scanning time was 90-min in length, wherein 30 frames were defined: 1 to 15 of 1-min duration and 16 to 30 of 5-min duration. A custom-fitted thermoplastic mask (Tru-Scan Imaging, Annapolis) was created for each subject and used with a head fixation system during PET scans to reduce movement during the acquisition. [11C]-(+)-PHNO was injected as a bolus followed by a flush of 2 mL saline into an intravenous line placed in an antecubital vein. The mean radioactivity dose was 9.38(±1.34)mCi, with a specific activity of 1160.82(±401.58)mCi/µmol, an injected mass of 2.07(±0.46)µg, and an injected mass per kilogram of 0.03(±0.008)µg/Kg. None of the participants included in this sample reported nausea associated with [11C]-(+)-PHNO injection.
2.3. MRI imaging
Subjects provided a T1-weighted MRI image (TE=17, TR=6000, FOV=22 cm 2D, 256×256, slice thickness of 2 mm, NEX=2) acquired on a 1.5 T Signa scanner (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). These images were used to enhance the analysis of PET scans, via co-registration (described in detail below, under [11C]-(+)-PHNO Image Analyses).
2.4. [11C]-(+)-PHNO Image Analyses
Two complementary approaches were employed for quantifying [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the retina. For the first approach (termed “manual”), retina ROIs were drawn manually on each subjects averaged dynamic [11C]-(+)-PHNO image in native-space (on every slice where the retina could be observed), employing previous PET guidelines (See Fig. 2). These manually drawn ROIs were then used to extract time activity curves from each subjects' dynamic PET image in native-space (See Fig. 3). This was done with reference to each subjects co-registered T1-weighted MRI image, to confirm the placement of the retina ROIs. The co-registration of each subjects MRI to PET space was done using the normalized mutual information algorithm as implemented in SPM2 (SPM2, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). The TACs from the manually drawn retina ROIs were analyzed using both the Simplified Reference Tissue Method (SRTM) and Ichise's Multilinear Reference Tissue Model (MRTM), both of which have been validated for use with [11C]-(+)-PHNO. For both models, the cerebellum was used as the reference region to derive a quantitative estimate of binding – binding potential relative to the non-displaceable compartment (BPND) – as defined by the consensus nomenclature for in vivo imaging of reversibly binding radioligands. It has been noted for in vivo human studies with [11C]-(+)-PHNO that there is a small displaceable signal in cerebellum (BPND=~0.4) representing binding to D3R in cerebellar lobes IX and X. Thus, while we have done our best to exclude lobes IX and X in our cerebellar ROI, using the cerebellum as the reference region with [11C]-(+)-PHNO may result in some underestimation of BPND at D3R. Moreover, we recognize that use of the SRTM and MRTM is predicated on the assumption that blood flow into and out of the target and reference regions are similar. This assumption may not be true for both the blood-brain barrier (cerebellar reference region) and the retina-brain barrier (retina target region), thus biasing our estimate of BPND. This poses a limitation in quantification which can only be avoided using arterial sampling of [11C]-(+)-PHNO, which is both invasive and costly. For the second approach (termed “automated”), the basis function implementation of the SRTM was applied to the dynamic PET images to generate parametric voxel-wise BPND maps using PMOD (v2.7, PMOD Technologies, Zurich, Switzerland). These images were spatially normalized into MNI brain space by Nearest Neighbour Interpolation with a voxel size fixed in 2 × 2 × 2 mm3 using SPM2. Regional BPND estimates were then derived from a manually drawn retina ROI defined in MNI space. The drawing of this ROI was aided by superimposing the average of the parametric voxel-wise BPND maps of all the subjects onto an MNI template.
2.5. Post-mortem retinal tissue samples
Post-mortem retinal tissues from four patients with schizophrenia, and four age- and sex-matched healthy controls, were acquired from the St. Michael's Hospital Human Eye Biobank (http://www.stmichaelshospital.com/eye-biobank/; Toronto, Ontario, Canada) (See Table 3). Samples were formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE).
2.6. Sample preparation and high-resolution parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analyses
Total sample homogenates (approx. 2 µg) were subjected to a modified filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) protocol as previously described, with additional precipitation using an equal volume of 2M KCL for depletion of residual detergents. Lys-C and tryptic peptides were combined and processed on Pierce C18 Tips reversed phase resin (Thermo Scientific) for desalting and concentration. High-resolution parallel reaction monitoring (HR-PRM) analyses were performed on a Q Exactive HF quadrupole–orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an EASY nanoflow liquid chromatography (EASY-nLC™) system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a 50 cm column (75 µm inner diameter) packed with PepMap®RSLC C18 resin at 60 °C, using a flow rate of 250 nl/min on a 0%–42% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% formic acid (FA) gradient and Buffer B (80% ACN with 0.1% FA) over 60 min. Column washes were performed on a 30%–90% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid gradient for 2 min. The IonMax electrospray ion source settings were: spray voltage, +1900 V and capillary temperature, +250 °C. In the PRM method, we only observed charge states as described in the inclusion list and skyline file. The targeted MS/MS was run at an Orbitrap resolution of 30,000 at m/z 200, an AGC target value of 2 × 105, and maximum fill times of 100 ms. The targeted peptide was isolated using a 0.8 m/z unit window. Fragmentation was performed with normalized collision energy (NCE) of 32 eV. In the PRM method, we only observed charge states as described in the inclusion list and skyline file. Seven peptides and their corresponding heavy peptides (Table 4) were comprised in the inclusion list. Target peptides were selected based on in silico cleavage of the proteins using the Peptide Mass feature of ExPASy bioinformatics portal (http://web.expasy.org/peptide_mass/). The following settings were used: enzyme (trypsin); 0 missed cleavage and display the peptides with a mass bigger than 500 Da.
2.7. PRM data analysis
Mass spectrometry analysis was performed at the SPARC Biocentre (The Hospital for Sick Children; SickKids, Toronto). We attempted to quantify 4 and 3 unique peptides for D2R and D3R, respectively (see Table 4). However, because of the relatively low protein yield in our FFPE slide samples, only a single unique peptide of either protein was detected and subsequently used for identification. Data analysis and quantification of PRM runs was performed using Skyline software. Relative quantification of D2R and D3R peptides from schizophrenia patient and control samples was based on the sum of the area under the curves (AUC) of the top three most intense peptide fragments. The use of a subset of three to six fragment ions (with acceptable peak purity) for peptide quantitation has been previously suggested to yield more accurate results than the entire set. Endogenous peptides were matched to heavy isotope peptides based on their similar retention times and transition patterns.
2.8. Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS (v.20) and GraphPad (v.5.0; GraphPad Software, La Jolla California). Normality of variables was determined using the D'Agostino-Pearson test. The significance level for all tests was set at p < .05 (two-tailed).
3. Results
[11C]-(+)-PHNO scans from 49 healthy participants (16 female; mean ± S.D. age: 36.96 ± 14.36; range: 18–73) were analyzed. Using both manual delineation techniques and automated methods, it was possible to quantify [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding (BPND) in the retina using commonly employed reference tissue models. The estimated parameters and model fits for [11C]-(+)-PHNO BPND in the retina are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Notably, the estimated [11C]-(+)-PHNO BPND in the retina, and associated model fits, fell within previously accepted ranges for other regions of interest (ROIs), such as the thalamus (average BPND, 95% CI): 0.36, 0.26–0.49; 0.44, 0.35–0.54.
A Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test demonstrated that the % covariance in manually derived retina BPND did not differ between choice of reference tissue model employed: the SRTM or MRTM (W=163, p=.42). However, the chi-square (χ2) total model fit was significantly better for the MRTM than the SRTM (W=−949, p < .0001), suggesting that the MRTM was better than the SRTM at modelling [11C]-(+)-PHNO BPND in the retina overall. This is similar to what has been suggested with other ROIs for [11C]-(+)-PHNO. The MRTM produced larger retina BPND estimates than the SRTM (W=515, p=.001).
The average measure interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between manually drawn SRTM and MRTM retina BPND estimates was 0.91, with a 95% CI from 0.84 to 0.95 (F(48,48)=11.70, p < .0001). The average measure ICC between the manually and automatically derived SRTM retina BPND estimates was 0.53, with a 95% CI from 0.19 to 0.73 (F(48,48)=2.23, p < .003), suggesting that the automatic, parametric SRTM method was less reliable.
The size of the manually drawn retina ROIs (mean ± S.D.) were 4217.22(±624.97) voxels, with an area of 6276.92(±930.21)mm2, and a volume of 7657.64(±1134.86)mm3.
We examined whether retina BPND was correlated with the size of the manually drawn ROIs from which they were derived. Retina SRTM BPND was not correlated with the total number of voxels (r(47)=0.18, p=.22), area (mm2) (r (47)=0.18, p=.22), nor the volume (mm3) (r(47)=0.18, p=.22) of the manually drawn retina ROIs. Similarly, retina MRTM BPND was not correlated with the total number of voxels (r(47)=0.16, p=.27), area (mm2) (r(47)=0.16, p=.27), nor the volume (mm3) (r(47)=0.16, p=.27) of the manually drawn retina ROIs. We examined whether retina BPND, from the manually drawn ROIs, was correlated with the injection parameters of [11C]-(+)-PHNO. Retina SRTM BPND was not correlated with the radioactivity dose (mCi) (r(47)=0.01, p=.94), specific activity (mCi/µmol) (r(47)=-0.11, p=.46), injected mass (µg) (r(47)=0.08, p=.57), nor the injected mass per kilogram (µg/Kg) (r(47)=0.18, p=.24) of [11C]-(+)-PHNO. Similarly, retina MRTM BPND was not correlated with the radioactivity dose (mCi) (r(47)=-0.05, p=.76), specific activity of (mCi/µmol) (r (47)=-0.20, p=.16), injected mass (µg) (r(47)=0.20, p=.16), nor the injected mass per kilogram (µg/Kg) (r(47)=0.21, p=.17) of [11C]-(+)-PHNO.
The χ2 total model fit did not differ between males and females (SRTM: U=213, p=.28; MRTM: U=258, p=.90). While males tended to have higher retina BPND's than females (SRTM: 0.81 ± 0 .66 vs 0.56 ± 0 .31; MRTM: 0.91 ± 0 .64 vs 0.60 ± 0 .35), this was not significant (SRTM: U=224.5, p=.41; MRTM: U=197, p=.16). Age was not correlated with the %covariance BPND for the SRTM (r (47)=0.20, p=.18), nor the MRTM (r(47)=0.12, p=.42). Age was not correlated with the χ2 total model fit for the SRTM (r(47)=0.15, p=.30), nor the MRTM (r(47)=0.11, p=.44). Age was not correlated with manually derived retina BPND, using the SRTM (r(47)=-0.07, p=.65) nor the MRTM (r(47)=-0.10, p=.49).
Since it was possible to quantify [11C]-(+)-PHNO BPND in the retina, we calculated retinal BPND values from 12 antipsychotic-naïve, first-episode patients with schizophrenia (4 female; mean ± S.D. age: 25.75 ± 6.25; range: 19–42). Retina BPND did not differ between patients and age- and sex-matched healthy controls measured with the SRTM (W=2, p=.97) and MRTM (W=16, p=.57) (See Fig. 4). In the first-episode patients, age of illness onset and illness duration were not correlated with [11C]-(+)-PHNO BPND in the retina (SRTM: age, r (9)=0.16, p=.63, duration r(9)=-0.27, p=.42; MRTM: age, r (9)=0.14, p=.68, duration r(9)=-0.22, p=.53).
We employed high-resolution PRM to determine the availability and relative amounts of DA D2R and D3R receptors in our human retina samples. The choice for PRM analysis was motivated by its sensitivity and selectivity in detecting/quantifying target proteins in complex samples, that are otherwise undetectable by Western blot analysis. Total protein was extracted from the FFPE human retina tissue slides, consisting of 4 biological replicates from schizophrenia patients and control subjects, and subsequently used to generate peptides for PRM analysis. Given the low protein yield of FFPE samples, we did not perform technical replicates for this analysis. Peptide intensities were normalized based on the total ion chromatogram (TIC) intensity of the samples measured in shotgun LC-MS/MS mode, in order to correct for variations in the total peptide amount injected for the different samples. We included 4 and 3 target peptides in our PRM method (Table 4) to probe D2R and D3R, respectively. We detected one unique peptide for D2R (YTAVAMPMLYNTR) based on matching co-elution of heavy/light peptides at 36.8 min, similar transition patterns and mass errors within the −5.6 - +2.8 ppm ppm range (see Supplementary Material). A single unique peptide for D3R (NSLSPTIAPK) was also detected at 24.3 min and with mass errors within −0.1- +2.4 ppm range (see Supplementary Material).
These unique peptide detections indicated that D2R and D3R are expressed in the human retina. Notably, D2R was significantly decreased in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls (t (6)=2.57, p=.04). However, there was no statistical difference with regards to levels of D3R (t(6)=1.18, p=.28) (see Fig. 5). Fold-change ratios for D2R and D3R in patients relative to controls are presented in the Supplementary Material.
4. Discussion
We observed significant uptake of the agonist D2/3R radiotracer [11C]-(+)-PHNO into the retina of humans. We examined whether this uptake could be meaningfully quantified using simple pharmacokinetic modelling. We observed that this uptake could be quantified, suggesting that [11C]-(+)-PHNO may be binding to D2R and/or D3R expressed in the human retina. Moreover, we found no difference in [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the retinas of first-episode, drug-naive patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls.
To ascertain whether D3R are expressed in the human retina, we employed targeted mass spectrometry in post-mortem retinal tissue. High-resolution PRM analysis revealed that indeed both D2R and D3R are expressed in the human retina at significant levels. Moreover, D2R expression in the retina was reduced in older, chronically treated patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. There was also a non-significant reduction in D3R expression observed in patients relative to controls.
Collectively, our post-mortem data demonstrates that both D2R and D3R are expressed in the human retina and that, on average, the expression of D3R is 11–12-times less than that of D2R. Given that D2R expression in the retina is several orders of magnitude higher than D3R expression, it is possible that zero percent of the uptake in the retina is due to [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding to D3R. However, it is important to note that since [11C]-(+)-PHNO has ~25- to 45-fold greater selectivity for D3R versus D2R in vivo it is possible that the majority of the [11C]-(+)-PHNO signal in a brain region can be attributable to D3R, despite having greater levels of D2R expressed therein. For example, in the substantia nigra it can be estimated ex vivo that there is roughly 3- to 4-times greater D2R expression compared to D3R. However, in vivo practically 100% of the [11C]-(+)-PHNO signal in the substantia nigra is due to binding to D3R. Unfortunately, without a blocking study employing a highly D3R-prefering antagonist, we are currently unable to estimate what proportion of the [11C]-(+)-PHNO signal in the retina, if any, is due to binding to D3R. Moreover, we could only observe significant uptake of [11C]-(+)-PHNO on our highest resolution PET camera – the HRRT, not the Siemens Biograph HiRez PETCT. Unfortunately, previously published D3R blocking studies with [11C]-(+)-PHNO aquired scans using a Siemens Biograph HiRez PETCT (with Truepoint Gantry, 3D-mode). Thus, significant uptake into the retina could also not be observed on these scans (personal communication, Dr. Graham Searle, April 17, 2018). Thus, future [11C]-(+)-PHNO blocking studies – acquired on the HRRT and employing highly selective D3R-preferring antagonists – are required to determine whether [11C]-(+)-PHNO is binding to retinal D3R and/or D2R in vivo.
Collectively, our data also suggests that both D2R and D3R may be reduced in older, treated patients with schizophrenia. However, this may not be the case in first-episode, drug-naïve patients. This appears prima facie consistent with evidence that DA receptor blockade by antipsychotics may cause degenerative retinopathies in patients with schizophrenia. Reductions in the retinal nerve fiber layer, macula, ganglion cell layer, and the inner plexiform layer is present in chronically treated patients with schizophrenia – although this has not been observed in all studies. In this regard, it is worth noting that thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer and outer retina layers has been associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal degeneration. Thus, it will be important to elucidate the relationship between D2/3R expression and structural integrity of the retina across various neuropsychiatric diseases. However, it is currently unclear how chronic antipsychotic exposure affects D2R and D3R expression in retina, and in turn visual functioning. For example, while several studies have demonstrated contrast sensitivity deficits in patients with schizophrenia, reports on the effects of antipsychotics on contrast sensitivity have been mixed. Some studies report abnormally low contrast sensitivity in unmedicated patients relative to medicated patients, while others report abnormally high baseline sensitivity which is reduced by short-term antipsychotic treatment. Further in vivo and ex vivo studies are required to examine the relationships between antipsychotic exposure on D2/3R expression and contrast sensitivity in patients with schizophrenia. While these aspects could not be examined in our current investigation, we believe this work marks as a first step towards elucidating this kind of information in the future.
Given that dopaminergic functioning in the retina may play diverse roles besides light adaptation, such as contributing to the development of myopia, it will be important to determine whether deficits in visual/retinal functioning in schizophrenia are inherent to the pathophysiology of the disease, or related to chronic D2/3R blockade by antipsychotics. For example, it has been well documented that the adverse ocular effects of chlorpromazine include miosis, blurred vision (caused by paralysis of accommodation), pigmentary changes in the retina, attenuation of retinal vessels, and optic nerve pallor. Moreover, given that loss of retinal DA has been observed in patients with Parkinson's disease, it will be important to determine whether D3R expression is altered in vivo and ex vivo, and how this may relate to visual functioning in these patients.
In contrast, evidence suggest that agonism of both DA D1 receptors (D1R) and D2R may be neuroprotective and a potentially effective intervention for ischemic or degenerative disorders in the retina and optic nerve. Notably, D3R agonism has been suggested to mediate neuroprotective effects on striatal DA neurons; although pro-cognitive effects of D3R antagonists in general has also been suggested. Since D1R and D3R form heterodimers in the striatum, it will be important to determine, i) whether D1R and D3R form heterodimers in the retina, and, ii) whether selective D3R agonism can mediate neuroprotective effects against neurodegeneration in the retina. To add to this complexity, it has been well established that D2R expression decreases with age in the striatum – even in patients with schizophrenia – while D3R expression may increase with age. Larger in vivo and ex vivo studies are required to determine whether or not D3R increases, while D2R decreases, with age in the retina, similar to what has been proposed for the striatum.
There are several limitations with the current investigation. First, our PET analysis was retrospective. Thus, we did not acquire information about visual/retinal functioning in our participants. This important information can be acquired by future prospective [11C]-(+)-PHNO studies. Notably, both our first-episode sample and our post-mortem retina samples were relatively small. While both of these samples are difficult to recruit/obtain, it will be important for future studies to employ larger samples in order to be sufficiently powered to detect important associations between retinal D2/3R availability and clinical/cognitive variables. Moreover, future [11C]-(+)-PHNO studies examining the retina should recruit a patient group with an established diagnosis of schizophrenia and/or schizoaffective disorder, to compare with first-episode and healthy controls. Second, in quantifying [11C]-(+)-PHNO BPND in the retina we employed a reference tissue model, which requires several assumptions to be met between the reference and target tissue (i.e., the retina and cerebellum). Thus, it will be important to further validate our quantification of BPND in the retina using arterial sampling. This in turn would help overcome any potential issues regarding underestimation of binding to D3R in the retina due to specific binding to D3R in the cerebellum. Third, the characterization of our participants in the post-mortem retina sample was incomplete. Namely, information about history of psychotic symptoms, history of antipsychotic drug usage, and cause of death was unavailable. Fourth, our retina tissue samples were formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded. It will be important to attempt to replicate our findings using unfixed, fresh tissue. Fifth, it will be important to determine where, and on which cell types, D3R are expressed in the human retina. However, this knowledge may be contingent upon future advances in the development of D3R selective antibodies and radioligands. Finally, due to limitations in radiosynthesis methods, all [11C]-(+)-PHNO scans are acquired under non-tracer conditions. Specifically, tracer conditions (less than 10% D3R occupancy by (+)-PHNO) would require an injected mass of 4.5 ng/kg, or 0.3 µg of (+)-PHNO in a 70 kg person. Thus, given non-tracer conditions, the signal from D3R blockade may be underestimated and physiological side-effects from tracer injection may occur. Notably, it has been reported that a 40 ng/kg mass dose of [11C]-(+)-PHNO is associated with 50% occupancy of D3R. In our current investigation, the average injected mass was 30 ng/kg. Thus, our [11C]-(+)-PHNO scans were also conducted under non-tracer conditions, likely resulting in significant occupancy of D3R (≤50%). While this is a currently unavoidable limitation of [11C]-(+)-PHNO studies, none of the participants in this report experienced physiological side-effects (i.e. nausea or vomiting) in response to the injection of [11C]-(+)-PHNO. It is currently unclear what makes certain participants more susceptible to experiencing physiological side-effects in response to [11C]-(+)-PHNO injection, even at relatively lower reported averaged injected masses with constant infusion.
The demonstration of D3R expression in the human retina, and the potential to quantify retinal D3R availability in vivo with [11C]-(+)-PHNO, opens several new avenues of inquiry for elucidating the role of retinal DA in visual processing, in health and disease.
